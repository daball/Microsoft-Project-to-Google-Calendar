gen ClosedChannelException "
 * Checked exception thrown when an attempt is made to invoke or complete an
 * I/O operation upon channel that is closed, or at least closed to that
 * operation.  That this exception is thrown does not necessarily imply that
 * the channel is completely closed.  A socket channel whose write half has
 * been shut down, for example, may still be open for reading." \

gen FileLockInterruptionException "
 * Checked exception received by a thread when another thread interrupts it
 * while it is waiting to acquire a file lock.  Before this exception is thrown
 * the interrupt status of the previously-blocked thread will have been set." \

gen AsynchronousCloseException "
 * Checked exception received by a thread when another thread closes the
 * channel or the part of the channel upon which it is blocked in an I/O
