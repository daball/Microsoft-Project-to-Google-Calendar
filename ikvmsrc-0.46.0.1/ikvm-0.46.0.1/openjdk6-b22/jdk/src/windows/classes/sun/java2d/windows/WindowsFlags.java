    /**
     * Description of command-line flags.  All flags with [true|false]
     * values (where both have possible meanings, such as with ddlock)
     * have an associated variable that indicates whether this flag
     * was set by the user.  For example, d3d is on by default, but
     * may be disabled at runtime by internal settings unless the user
     * has forced it on with d3d=true.  These associated variables have
     * the same base (eg, d3d) but end in "Set" (eg, d3dEnabled and
     * d3dSet).
     *      ddEnabled: usage: "-Dsun.java2d.noddraw[=true]"
     *               turns off all usage of ddraw, including surface -> surface
     *               Blts (including onscreen->onscreen copyarea), offscreen
     *               surface creation, and surface locking via DDraw.
     *      ddOffscreenEnabled: usage: "-Dsun.java2d.ddoffscreen=false"
     *               disables the use of ddraw surfaces for offscreen
     *               images.  Effectively disables use of ddraw for most
     *               operations except onscreen scrolling and some locking.
     *      ddVramForced: usage: "-Dsun.java2d.ddforcevram=true"
     *               Disables punts of offscreen ddraw surfaces to ddraw
     *               system memory.  We use a punting mechanism when we detect
     *               a high proportion of expensive read operations on a ddraw
     *               surface; this flag disables that mechanism and forces the
     *               surfaces to remain in VRAM regardless.
     *      ddLockEnabled:  usage: "-Dsun.java2d.ddlock=[true|false]"
     *               forces on|off usage of DirectDraw for locking the
     *               screen.  This feature is usually enabled by default
     *               for pre-Win2k OS's and disabled by default for
     *               Win2k and future OS's (as of jdk1.4.1).
     *      gdiBlitEnabled: usage: "-Dsun.java2d.gdiblit=false"
     *               turns off Blit loops that use GDI for copying to
     *               the screen from certain image types.  Copies will,
     *               instead, happen via ddraw locking or temporary GDI DIB
     *               creation/copying (depending on OS and other flags)
     *      ddBlitEnabled: usage: "-Dsun.java2d.ddblit=false"
     *               turns off Blit loops that use DDraw for copying to
     *               the screen from other ddraw surfaces.  Copies will use
     *               fallback mechanisms of GDI blits or ddraw locks, as
     *               appropriate.  This flag is primarily for debugging
     *               purposes, to force our copies through a different code
     *               path.
     *      ddScaleEnabled: usage: "-Dsun.java2d.ddscale=true"
     *               Turns on hardware-accelerated iamge scaling via ddraw.
     *               This is off by default because we cannot guarantee the
     *               quality of the scaling; hardware may choose to do
     *               filtered or unfiltered scales, resulting in inconsistent
     *               scaling between ddraw-accelerated and java2D-rendered
     *               operations.  This flag and capability should go away
     *               someday as we eventually should use Direct3D for any
     *               scaling operation (where we can control the filtering
     *               used).
     *      d3dEnabled: usage: "-Dsun.java2d.d3d=[true|false]"
     *               Forces our use of Direct3D on or off.  Direct3D is on
     *               by default, but may be disabled in some situations, such
     *               as when running on Itanium, or on a card with bad d3d line
     *               quality, or on a video card that we have had bad experience
     *               with (e.g., Trident).  This flag can force us to use d3d
     *               anyway in these situations.  Or, this flag can force us to
     *               not use d3d in a situation where we would use it otherwise.
     *      translAccelEnabled: usage: "-Dsun.java2d.translaccel=true"
     *               Turns on hardware acceleration for some translucent
     *               image copying via Direct3D.  Images that are created with
     *               GraphicsConfiguration.createCompatibleImage(w, h, trans)
     *               may be acceleratable by use a Direct3D texture and
     *               performing copying operations to other DirectX-based
     *               image destinations via a textured quad.  This capability
     *               is disabled by default pending further testing and fixing
     *               some minor bugs (such as the ability to render Direct3D
     *               to the screen which completely ignores the desktop
     *               clip list).  When this capability is turned on by default,
     *               this flag should go away.  Note: currently, enabling this
     *               flag also enables the ddVramForced flag.  This is because
     *               d3d translucency acceleration can only happen to offscreen
     *               surfaces which have not been punted through the means that
     *               ddVramForced disables.
     *      offscreenSharingEnabled: usage: "-Dsun.java2d.offscreenSharing=true"
     *               Turns on the ability to share a hardware-accelerated
     *               offscreen surface through the JAWT interface.  See
     *               src/windows/native/sun/windows/awt_DrawingSurface.* for
     *               more information.  This capability is disabled by default
     *               pending more testing and time to work out the right
     *               solution; we do not want to expose more public JAWT api
     *               without being very sure that we will be willing to support
     *               that API in the future regardless of other native
     *               rendering pipeline changes.
     *      d3dTexBpp: usage: "-Dsun.java2d.d3dtexbpp=[16|32]
     *               When translucent image acceleration is enabled (see
     *               translAccelEnabled above), this flag specifies the bit
     *               depth of the software (BufferedImage) and hardware
     *               (textures) that we should use.  The default is to use
     *               32 bit images and textures, but specifying a value of 16
     *               for this flag will force us to use a color model of 4444
     *               and 16-bit textures.  This can be useful for applications
     *               with heavy requirements on constrained VRAM resources.
     *      accelReset: usage: "-Dsun.java2d.accelReset"
     *               This flag tells us to reset any persistent information
     *               the display device acceleration characteristics so that
     *               we are forced to retest these characteristics.  This flag
     *               is primarily used for debugging purposes (to allow testing
     *               of the persistent storage mechanisms) but may also be
     *               needed by some users if, for example, a driver upgrade
     *               may change the runtime characteristics and they want the
     *               tests to be re-run.
     *      checkRegistry: usage: "-Dsun.java2d.checkRegistry"
     *               This flag tells us to output the current registry settings
     *               (after our initialization) to the console.
     *      disableRegistry: usage: "-Dsun.java2d.disableRegistry"
     *               This flag tells us to disable all registry-related
     *               activities.  It is mainly here for debugging purposes,
     *               to allow us to see whether any runtime bugs are caused
     *               by or related to registry problems.
     *      magPresent: usage: "-Djavax.accessibility.screen_magnifier_present"
     *               This flag is set either on the command line or in the
     *               properties file.  It tells Swing whether the user is
     *               currently using a screen magnifying application.  These
     *               applications tend to conflict with ddraw (which assumes
     *               it owns the entire display), so the presence of these
     *               applications implies that we should disable ddraw.
     *               So if magPresent is true, we set ddEnabled and associated
     *               variables to false and do not initialize the native
     *               hardware acceleration for these properties.
     *      opengl: usage: "-Dsun.java2d.opengl=[true|True]"
     *               Enables the use of the OpenGL-pipeline.  If the
     *               OpenGL flag is specified and WGL initialization is
     *               successful, we implicitly disable the use of DirectDraw
     *               and Direct3D, as those pipelines may interfere with the
     *               OGL pipeline.  (If "True" is specified, a message will
     *               appear on the console stating whether or not the OGL
     *               was successfully initialized.)
     * setHighDPIAware: Property usage: "-Dsun.java2d.dpiaware=[true|false]"
     *               This property flag "sun.java2d.dpiaware" is used to
     *               override the default behavior, which is:
     *               On Windows Vista, if the java process is launched from a
     *               known launcher (java, javaw, javaws, etc) - which is
     *               determined by whether a -Dsun.java.launcher property is set
     *               to "SUN_STANDARD" - the "high-DPI aware" property will be
     *               set on the native level prior to initializing the display.
